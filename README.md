A Flutter project for Vehicle Number Plate Detection


Our project aims to develop an automated system that captures vehicle images
through a mobile application to detect vehicle type and gather owner information.
Registered vehicles are recognised instantly on subsequent visits, eliminating the
need for re-registration and streamlining access management. This approach of
ours enhances efficiency and security by reducing manual effort and providing real-
time monitoring of vehicle entry.
In an organisation, efficient management of vehicle access is crucial for security.
The current manual processes of vehicle registration and monitoring are time-
consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays and inefficiencies. To address
these challenges, we propose the development of an automated vehicle detection
and recognition system that uses the mobile-based image capture technology.
